# WannaBe bitfinex

![Looks](/img/img.jpg?raw=true "Optional Title")

# To Run:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

# To Build Minify:

```
yarn build
```

## Notes:
* redux-logger is on. Left it on to see Redux in action.
Some room for improvement:
* Handling various websocket response arrays. Don't understand what te, tu, hb, means.
* Graph. Need more time to hack away at D3.
* CSS is not perfectly matching Bitfinex. Function before beauty.
* Hard coded to BTCUSD. Could easily be switched out for a select box.
