# WannaBe bitfinex

![Looks](/img/img.jpg?raw=true "Optional Title")

# To Run:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

# To Build Minify:

```
yarn build
```

## Notes:
Some room for improvement:
* Handling various websocket response arrays. Don't understand what te, tu, hb, means.
* Graph
* CSS is not perfectly matching Bitfinex. Function before beauty.
* Hard coded to BTCUSD. Could easily be switched.
